          A place I share learnings through my journey.
Hi there, great to meet you here. My name is Neilï¼Œcurrently working as a Data Engineer operating in the cloud.
Previously I was working in DevOps capacity, focusing on building useful CICD pipelines, automations, APIs and else.

          &lt;p&gt;Recently I was tasked with consuming data from websocket, analyse it and then send data to Prometheus.
The theory is pretty straight forward: getting data from websocket API in a stream and analyse and take the data points and send it to prometheus for visulization.
In this blog you will have all the steps and code needed to reporduce this flow.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Recently I was tasked with consuming data from websocket, analyse it and then send data to Prometheus.
The theory is pretty straight forward: getting data from websocket API in a stream and analyse and take the data points and send it to prometheus for visulization.
In this blog you will have all the steps and code needed to reporduce this flow.&lt;/p&gt;
