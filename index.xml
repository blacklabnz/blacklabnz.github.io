      <description>Recently I was tasked with consuming data from websocket, analyze it and then send data to Prometheus. The theory is pretty straight forward: getting data from websocket API in a stream and analyze and take the data points and send it to prometheus for visualization. In this blog you will have all the steps and code needed to reproduce this flow. With this in mind, I decided using python to achieve all these.</description>

      <description>The hub and spoke topology has been widely adopted for enterprise production deployment. In this lab, let put on our network engineer hat and get our hand dirty on Azure Hub and spoke topology with one of the popular IaC &amp;ndash; Terraform. Lets have a look at the high level architecture first. hubandspoke The essence of the topology is, but the name of it, having all traffic routed to hub network before forwarded to spoke network.</description>

      <description>What an interesting topic I had recently regarding on security hardening Databricks using Secure cluster connectivity + vNet injection.
This configuration will allow the cluster to access Azure Data Lake Storage (I know right ?! what a popular combination!) and keyvault with private endpoint.
In this post, in a lab environment, we will find out how we can put Databricks cluster inside existing Azure virtual network and access private endpoint deployed inside it.</description>
